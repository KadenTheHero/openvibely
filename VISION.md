# OpenVibely Vision

OpenVibely exists to make AI software development feel like running a capable,
auditable team instead of juggling disconnected chat sessions.

The long-term goal is a self-hosted command center where one project-aware
conversation can plan work, split it into tasks, run specialized agents in
parallel, review their changes, learn from the results, and keep unfinished
goals moving without losing human control.

Agents do the work. Humans stay in command.

## The Product We Are Building

OpenVibely should become the recursive self-improvement control plane for
software teams.

That means:

- A user can describe an outcome once, then watch the system turn it into
  reviewable, executable work.
- Each task has a visible lifecycle: prompt, model, agent, logs, thread,
  attachments, changed files, review comments, schedules, goals, memory, and
  skill usage.
- Work happens in isolated, inspectable branches or worktrees so AI output is
  never a hidden mutation.
- Chat remains the coordination surface for the whole project, while task
  detail pages remain the operational surface for individual units of work.
- The system improves through durable project memory and reusable skills, not
  through opaque personalization or unreviewable background behavior.
- Teams can run it themselves, keep their data, choose their model providers,
  and understand what happened after every run.

## Why It Matters

The first wave of coding agents made individual developers faster, but often by
moving work into scattered, disposable sessions. Context gets repeated. Diffs
appear without a clear chain of intent. Follow-up work depends on whoever
remembers to ask for it. Lessons learned in one run rarely make the next run
better.

OpenVibely is built around a different premise: AI development work should be
orchestrated, inspectable, repeatable, and improvable.

The product should help a team answer:

- What are we trying to accomplish?
- Which agents are working on it?
- What changed?
- Why did it change?
- What still needs attention?
- What did the system learn that should help next time?

## Principles

### Chat Is The Control Plane

The project chat should be the place where fuzzy intent becomes coordinated
execution. Users should be able to plan, create tasks, steer active work,
inspect status, schedule follow-ups, and ask what comes next without opening a
new AI session for every subproblem.

### Tasks Are The Unit Of Accountability

Every meaningful piece of work should become a task with durable state,
execution history, reviewable output, and clear status. A task should be small
enough to inspect and steer, but rich enough to carry the context an agent needs
to make real progress.

### Autonomy Must Stay Reviewable

OpenVibely should automate the boring and repetitive parts of software work, but
not hide them. Automated execution, scheduled work, task chaining, goal loops,
memory updates, and skill improvements should leave evidence that users can
inspect, question, undo, or refine.

### Local Ownership Is A Feature

Self-hosting, SQLite defaults, a single Go binary, desktop mode, and explicit
runtime paths are not incidental implementation details. They are part of the
promise: teams should be able to run the system close to their code and keep
control of operational state, credentials, repositories, and model choices.

### Model Choice Should Be Practical

OpenVibely should support multiple providers and auth paths without turning
provider setup into the product. The user should configure models once, assign
defaults or agents where useful, and then focus on work. Provider differences
should be normalized where possible and surfaced clearly where they matter.

### Memory Should Reduce Repetition

Project memory should preserve stable facts, decisions, conventions, pitfalls,
and implementation context that would otherwise be retyped into every prompt.
It should stay project-scoped, compact, inspectable, and curated rather than
becoming an unbounded transcript dump.

### Skills Should Make Agents Better

Skills are how completed work becomes future leverage. The system should learn
reusable workflows, domain habits, review checklists, and operational runbooks
from successful tasks while keeping those skills visible and editable.

### Integrations Should Bring Work To The System

Slack, Telegram, GitHub, webhooks, the REST API, and future channels should make
OpenVibely easier to use from where teams already operate. Integrations should
create and coordinate real project work rather than becoming separate products
with separate sources of truth.

### The UI Should Favor Operational Clarity

OpenVibely is an operations surface, not a marketing page. Screens should make
status, actions, diffs, logs, schedules, and review state easy to scan. The
interface should feel calm, dense, and dependable when a team has many agents
and tasks in motion.

## What We Will Not Optimize For

OpenVibely should not become:

- A black-box autonomous developer that changes code without review.
- A thin chat wrapper with no durable task, diff, memory, or scheduling model.
- A hosted-only SaaS that requires teams to give up ownership of their runtime
  state.
- A single-provider product where model choice is locked into one vendor.
- A project-management clone where AI execution is secondary.
- A pile of prompt templates with no lifecycle, learning, or audit trail.

## Direction

The product should keep deepening the loop that already defines it:

1. A user describes a goal in Chat.
2. OpenVibely turns the goal into concrete tasks.
3. Agents execute those tasks with the right model, skills, memory, and tools.
4. The user reviews diffs, threads, logs, and lifecycle evidence.
5. Goal loops, schedules, and integrations keep useful work moving.
6. Memory Curator and Skill Curator preserve what should improve the next run.

Near-term product decisions should strengthen that loop. Features are most
valuable when they make work easier to orchestrate, safer to review, clearer to
operate, or more reusable over time.

The north star is not simply "more automation." It is compounding capability
under human command.
