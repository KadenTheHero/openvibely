title: OpenVibely Architecture
---

OpenVibely is an open-source Go application for automated task scheduling and AI-powered execution. Users create tasks, schedule them, and have LLM agents execute them automatically.

The backend uses Echo v4, SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite`, goose migrations, and a channel-based worker pool. The frontend is server-rendered with HTMX, templ, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI.

Dual mode architecture:
- `internal/server.Start(ctx, cfg)` wires the shared backend and returns a server instance with bound address, base URL, and shutdown handle.
- Local web/server and desktop release-binary runs default DB/repos/uploads and related runtime state to the same user app-data directory, specifically `$HOME/.openvibely` unless an env override applies.
- Hosted/Docker deployments use explicit env-driven storage such as mounted `/data` paths rather than local `$HOME/.openvibely` behavior.
- Desktop mode (`cmd/desktop`) uses `config.LoadWithMode(ModeDesktop)`, ephemeral port `PORT=0`, local repo paths, and Wails WebView loading from the server base URL.
- `make package-desktop-macos` builds a raw intermediate executable and packages it as `OpenVibely.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenVibely`; release builds should ship architecture-specific unsigned zips containing a Finder-recognized `OpenVibely.app` bundle. App bundle archives are name-sensitive and must preserve the directory name exactly as `OpenVibely.app`.
- `OPENVIBELY_APP_DATA_DIR` is the shared override for the local app-data root when users need web/server and desktop to point at the same runtime state; explicit overrides bypass legacy-path migration into another app-data default.
- `OPENVIBELY_APP_DATA_DIR` is read as a literal path by config loading; shell `~` expansion is not performed, so quoted `~` assignments can point at an unintended relative directory.
- Env vars override mode defaults. `DATABASE_PATH`, `PROJECT_REPO_ROOT`, and related storage env vars remain explicit paths; `DATABASE_PATH` overrides database location even when `OPENVIBELY_APP_DATA_DIR` is set.
- Desktop defaults to localhost OAuth callback flow (`APP_BASE_URL` unset). Server/VPS mode uses `APP_BASE_URL` for hosted callbacks.
- Desktop/Wails GUI launches, especially on macOS, may not inherit the user's interactive shell `PATH`; task execution relies on centralized environment/PATH construction rather than hardcoded developer-tool paths.
- The packaged desktop binary reads environment variables from `config.env` in the OS-conventional config directory, overridden by `OPENVIBELY_DESKTOP_CONFIG_FILE` when set.
- Desktop external-link handling depends on the actual loaded Wails runtime API because the WebView may be loaded from the local server URL rather than a `wails:` page.
- Desktop file/folder selection UX favors Wails/native dialog APIs because browser-only upload features such as `webkitdirectory` are not consistently reliable across OS-native WebViews.
- Server and desktop share `internal/server`; backend forking is not part of the intended architecture.

Storage and runtime-state pitfalls:
- Storage changes maintain compatibility across Docker/VPS, local server, and desktop deployments.
- Docker/VPS persist under mounted `/data` paths where applicable.
- Local storage migrations preserve existing user state by moving/copying the old local database, SQLite sidecars, repos, uploads, and related runtime directories into `$HOME/.openvibely` when no explicit storage override is set. `OPENVIBELY_DISABLE_LEGACY_STORAGE_MIGRATION` skips this migration.
- `OPENVIBELY_RUNTIME_DIR` is a deprecated `start.sh`-only alias for `OPENVIBELY_APP_DATA_DIR`; it is not read by the binary directly.
- Release binaries use stable app-owned storage rather than source-checkout/current-working-directory paths such as `./openvibely.db` or `./repos`.
- Web/server and desktop local runs are expected to use the same database by default unless env vars explicitly separate them.
- Local runtime-state diagnosis depends on the active process, port, and database path because multiple local/server/desktop instances may use different configured storage roots.

OAuth and base URLs:
- Model OAuth initiate/callback resolves absolute app URLs through shared URL-building behavior: `APP_BASE_URL` first, then forwarded/request host fallback.
- Hosted deployments use `APP_BASE_URL` so Anthropic/OpenAI OAuth redirects stay on the public hostname.
- Without `APP_BASE_URL`, OAuth keeps localhost callback-server behavior for local development.

Hosted deployment state:
- Current Hostinger VPS state as of 2026-06-14: VPS id `1580249`, hostname `srv1580249.hstgr.cloud`, plan `KVM 2`, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, public IPv4 `2.24.193.101`, public IPv6 `2a02:4780:75:dff5::1`, state `running`.
- Hostinger Docker Compose projects are managed under `/docker/<project>/docker-compose.yml`.
- Running projects on that VPS include `agency` (`openvibely/openvibely-agency:latest`, port `3002`), `openvibely` (`openvibely/openvibely:latest`, port `3001`), `openvibely-docs` (`openvibely/openvibely-docs:latest`, port `4173`, `pull_policy: always`, `restart: unless-stopped`, Traefik-routed at `docs.openvibely.ai` with Let's Encrypt TLS), and `httpbin-traefik` (`traefik:latest`).
- `httpbin` (`kennethreitz/httpbin:latest`) was stopped as of 2026-06-14 and may be unused.

Shared conventions:
- `internal/handler` is the Echo HTTP boundary: `handler.go` owns the shared `Handler` dependency graph and route registration, while feature-specific files attach methods for tasks, projects, chat, models, auth, integrations, SSE, worktrees, and HTMX/API surfaces.
- Templates and JS reuse existing shared helpers/utilities and feature-detect optional elements.
- UI code uses existing components/partials and shared CSS tokens instead of duplicating styles.
- Swagger/OpenAPI is generated with `swag init`; generated docs live under `docs/` and the UI is mounted at `/swagger/*`.
- User-facing documentation also lives under `docs/`, generally as concise `*-user-guide.md` Markdown pages that match the existing guide structure. README/docs-site preferences live in `coding_agent_product_discipline.md`.
- Task board completed-column date ordering uses a dedicated nullable `tasks.completed_at` timestamp, set when tasks enter the completed category and cleared when they leave; backlog date ordering continues to use task creation time, so backlog and completed sort keys/validation are column-specific.

Local development workflow:
- `make dev` currently delegates directly to `air`; without a repo `.air.toml`, it only provides backend rebuild/restart behavior for Go changes through Air defaults, not browser hot reload.
- Editing `.templ` files requires `templ generate` or a separate `templ generate --watch` process before Go rebuilds see template changes.
- Tailwind/CSS changes require a separate Tailwind build/watch process; `make dev` does not currently run one.

Runtime logging:
- OpenVibely uses `internal/applog` as the runtime logging facade: `Infof` emits operational logs, while `Debugf` is gated by `OPENVIBELY_LOG_LEVEL=debug` and defaults off at info level.
- `start.sh` defaults `OPENVIBELY_LOG_LEVEL` to `info` while preserving env or `.env` overrides.
- App logging across internal/pkg/cmd code should go through `applog` unless a component intentionally owns a `*log.Logger` dependency or uses fatal/setup-only standard-log behavior.
- Raw LLM/user content, high-frequency stream/SSE/diff/poll/routing traces, and OpenAI/Anthropic provider header or rate-limit dumps are debug-level diagnostics, not info logs.
- Streaming persistence errors and final one-time stream lifecycle summaries can remain info-level, but periodic/eager streaming flush success counters during active generation are debug-level noise.
