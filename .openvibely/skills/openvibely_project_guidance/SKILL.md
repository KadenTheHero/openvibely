# OpenVibely Project Guidance

Use this project-managed skill for coding-agent work in the OpenVibely repository or closely related sibling repos. Durable project context, feature decisions, user preferences, feedback, and task/chat lessons belong in managed memory under this repository's `.openvibely/memories/` directory, not root markdown instruction files.

## Stop First

- Never create documentation or summary files for your work. Do not create `*_FIX.md`, `*_SUMMARY.md`, `*_VERIFICATION.md`, `README_*.md`, `TECHNICAL_*.md`, `ACTION_PLAN_*.md`, `FINDINGS_*.md`, `INVESTIGATION_*.md`, `COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt`, QA checklist files, or similar summary markdown. The code and commit messages are the documentation.
- Before editing code, verify the actual filesystem target. Run or otherwise confirm `pwd`, `git status --short --branch`, and `git worktree list` when the task mentions an isolated worktree, follow-up task branch, or explicit worktree path. If the current tool working directory is not the assigned worktree, use absolute paths into the assigned worktree for file tools and `git -C <worktree>`/`cd <worktree> && ...` for shell commands. Do not rely on relative paths until this is confirmed; accidental edits to the main checkout must be treated as a workflow bug and repaired before continuing.
- Avoid validation loops, but do not leave compile or test failures unresolved after code edits. Make all intended code changes first, run the required validation chain once, fix any failures, and rerun only when needed to confirm the fix.
- If code changed, use `-count=1` for tests. Skip it only when re-running without code changes and cached results are acceptable.
- Avoid read-only tool loops. Repeated `read_file`, `list_files`, and `grep_search` calls without progress usually mean missing objective or weak handoff context.
- Use parallel tool execution only for read-only tools. If a turn includes `write_file`, `edit_file`, `bash`, or any unknown or mutating tool, execute serially.
- For `edit_file`, expand stable surrounding context when a replacement fails instead of retrying the same snippet. Use bulk replacement only when intentionally replacing every occurrence.
- When a user asks to intentionally fail a task to trigger OpenVibely failure alerts, output the explicit failure marker required by the current runtime/instructions; merely describing an exit code or claiming failure is insufficient. If the marker is not already in the prompt, inspect the relevant marker-extraction instructions/code and emit the exact marker, not a paraphrase.
- When a user asks to explain something better, says "no word salad", or challenges a prior diagnosis, explain the exact current bug, fix, or evidence in plain causal terms. Re-read the current diff/context if needed; do not paste unrelated instruction templates, cite stale commits as proof of a live fix, or claim a bug is fixed without current validation evidence.

## Critical Rules

- Never delete, truncate, or overwrite `openvibely.db`; it contains user data.
- Never run `DROP TABLE` on production tables except in goose migrations.
- Never run `DELETE FROM` without a `WHERE` clause on production tables.
- Never change `busy_timeout`, `MaxOpenConns`, or `_loc=UTC` in `internal/database/database.go`.
- Never write tests that hit real LLM APIs or spawn CLI subprocesses. Use `models.ProviderTest` with `SetLLMCaller(testutil.NewMockLLMCaller())`.
- Strip `CLAUDECODE` from the environment when spawning Claude CLI subprocesses.
- Never persist or log GitHub App installation access tokens, GitHub PATs, private-key material, OAuth tokens, API keys, or webhook secrets. Mint operation tokens per operation and keep token use in process.
- Do not print raw prompts, streamed model tokens, provider payloads, OAuth/API-key data, or other content-carrying LLM data at info level. In high-frequency streaming paths, especially `internal/llm/stream.Writer`, do not call logging methods per chunk in normal code; leave raw stream `Debugf` instrumentation commented out and only temporarily uncomment it for a debugging session. For lower-frequency raw stream diagnostics outside hot chunk loops, use `internal/applog.Debugf` gated by `OPENVIBELY_LOG_LEVEL=debug`.
- Server-side git commands that may contact remotes must run non-interactively and use the same GitHub operation-token environment injection as clone/push paths.
- Use `TaskRepo.ClaimTask()` for atomic task claiming. Never set task status to `running` directly.
- Use parameterized SQL with `?` placeholders.
- Use `context.Context` for database and service calls.
- Respect foreign-key and CHECK constraints in test fixtures. Create referenced rows first and use valid enum values.

## Development Workflow

- Confirm where a change belongs before editing. Follow the layered architecture: `models -> repository -> service -> handler -> templates`.
- `models`: plain structs and domain rules.
- `repository`: raw SQL access with context-aware calls.
- `service`: orchestration and business logic.
- `handler`: HTTP parsing/rendering and response shaping.
- Prefer coherent end-to-end slices through the proper layers over scattered one-off edits.
- Keep changes minimal, explicit, and directly tied to the request.
- Do not add features, broad refactors, compatibility shims, fallback migrations, or abstractions unless the task requires them.
- When implementing a runbook/spec with exclusions, treat every non-excluded section as in scope.
- Identify the underlying product concept before coding; do not derive major behavior from incidental implementation shape such as tool lists, default flags, or temporary code structure.
- Put product policy that affects workflow, isolation, data writes, recovery, or review in explicit configuration, state, or data model.
- Keep generic capabilities generic. Model exceptional built-in-agent or workflow behavior through explicit configuration instead of hidden one-off cases.
- Derive environment/path values from authoritative user or system sources instead of hardcoded guessed locations. Project root, isolated worktree root, process working directory, durable repo location, app data root, and tool scope root are distinct concepts.
- Prefer product-correct defaults over mechanically convenient defaults.
- When editing model-facing prompts, preserve only context that helps the model act correctly. Do not add product names or internal category labels such as `OpenVibely`, `built-in system agent`, `system agent configuration`, or `non-system agent` just to make text sound project-specific; prefer direct role and boundary wording like `Skill Curator`, `Memory Curator`, `protected agent`, or `user-managed agent` when that distinction matters.
- Treat runtime tool descriptions, generated-agent/repair prompts, bundled agent root and skill bodies, scheduled task prompt bodies/titles, lifecycle prompt constants/templates, and prompt-safe hook input JSON as model-facing prompt surfaces. Audit them together for low-value product names or internal labels, not only files or constants named `Prompt`.
- Keep long model prompts as readable const templates with dynamic context interpolated, not chains of `WriteString` calls.
- Use logs intentionally. `logs/openvibely.log` is useful for behavior verification and diagnosis.
- When auditing runtime log noise, inspect `logs/openvibely.log` first and classify logs by operational value: keep errors, startup/shutdown, CRUD, task/execution creation, SSE lifecycle, completion metrics, and unusual state transitions at info; demote or comment out high-frequency HTMX poll/request counts, stream/delta/diff tick counters, and any content-carrying payloads or messages. Do not comment out every debug log: keep useful low-frequency diagnostics as active `applog.Debugf(...)` calls, and reserve fully commented-out debug instrumentation for hot loops, frequent polling, or payload dumps where even the method-call overhead or argument construction is wasteful. `start.sh` should default `OPENVIBELY_LOG_LEVEL` to `info` while allowing env or `.env` override.
- For handlers with setter-injected optional dependencies, validate required dependencies at handler entry and return controlled HTTP errors instead of nil-pointer panics.
- When introducing behavior modes, propagate mode through typed request contracts and enforce behavior in provider/tool policy layers, not only in prompt text.
- For task-execution actions, prefer exact entity targeting by `task_id` or `title`; reserve tag/priority filters for explicit group execution requests.
- If a user asks to create an OpenVibely task but not run it, create it as `category=backlog`; active-category task creation auto-submits to the worker. Prefer the real task creation API/handler over emitting a marker when the user wants an actual persisted task.
- If tasks run in isolated worktrees, include explicit worktree orientation in the model prompt while keeping runtime workdir enforcement as the source of truth.


## Adding Features

- New tables or columns require a new migration in `internal/database/migrations/` using the existing goose numbering pattern.
- New models belong in `internal/models/`, repositories in `internal/repository/`, services in `internal/service/`, and handlers in `internal/handler/`.
- Register new handlers and routes in `internal/handler/handler.go`.
- Update templates under `web/templates/**/*.templ` when UI changes are needed, then run `templ generate`.

## Testing And Validation

- Always create or update tests when fixing bugs or adding features.
- Every bug fix needs a regression test that reproduces the failure scenario.
- For cross-layer production changes, cover the touched wiring/call-site layer as well as lower-level service behavior.
- For consistent UI/API/provider/mode bugs, reproduce the exact reported path and verify the final provider-bound request or tool payload when relevant.
- For task-thread UI follow-up behavior, lifecycle DB rows, intermediate context objects, direct helper tests, and adjacent tool/API paths are not enough by themselves.
- Use `testutil.NewTestDB(t)` for DB-backed tests in the main Go app.
- Never use `t.Parallel()` with shared database connections.
- Production baseline should not assume a default model config. In tests, use `testutil.NewTestDB(t)` or create one explicitly.
- Run `templ generate` after modifying `.templ` files.
- After main Go app code changes, run the required validation chain at the end: `go build ./cmd/server && go test ./internal/... -count=1 -timeout 60s`. Include `templ generate &&` first if `.templ` files changed.

## Data Access

- Repositories use raw SQL, not an ORM.
- Prefer `QueryRowContext` with `RETURNING` for inserts that need created row data.
- Enforce cross-row invariants inside repository transactions so behavior remains correct when handlers or UI bypass optional workflows.
- When adding columns, update every SELECT that scans the struct, not only `GetByID` or list methods.
- Task SELECT mappings must include all current task columns, including follow-up, worktree, merge, lineage, origin, and agent-definition fields.
- Valid CHECK values include agent provider `anthropic`, `openai`, `ollama`, `test`; auth method `cli`, `oauth`, `api_key`; task status `pending`, `queued`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `blocked`; task merge status `''`, `pending`, `merged`, `failed`, `conflict`; schedule repeat type `once`, `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`.
- `models.Agent` and the `agents` table do not include a `color` field. Do not add it back.
- `projects` includes both `repo_path` and `repo_url`; keep model and repository CRUD mappings symmetric.
- SQLite table recreation migrations must use `-- +goose NO TRANSACTION`, disable and reenable foreign keys, recreate all indexes, and preserve CHECK constraints.

## Time And Scheduling

- Parse `datetime-local` form inputs with `time.ParseInLocation("2006-01-02T15:04", value, time.Local)`, not `time.Parse()`.
- Convert times to local with `.Local()` before formatting in templates.
- For daily, weekly, and monthly schedule `ComputeNextRun`, convert to local time, use `AddDate`, then convert back to UTC so DST transitions are safe.
- Do not use `time.Add(N*time.Hour)` for day arithmetic; use `time.AddDate(0, 0, N)`.
- `ComputeNextRun` for one-time schedules returns `nil` after execution.

## Frontend Practices

- Use HTMX forms with explicit `method="post"` and return the appropriate fragment/container.
- Keep client-side behavior deterministic. Avoid duplicate listener registration and brittle swap assumptions.
- Scope page-specific selectors to unique roots such as `#chat-page-root`; avoid generic `[data-project-id]` selectors that appear on multiple pages.
- For inline scripts inside HTMX-swapped fragments, use window-level one-time binding guards.
- Prefer app-scoped `HX-Trigger` events bridged in the base layout for cross-page toast feedback.
- For async actions, show explicit in-progress state, disable conflicting actions, and restore state in `finally`.
- Pair template-level action gating with server-side enforcement.
- Guard async refreshes against out-of-order responses.
- Batch high-frequency streaming UI updates with `requestAnimationFrame` and flush on completion.
- Preserve drafts during polling by keying them to entity identity and clearing only on successful intentional submits.
- Escape raw HTML-like tags before markdown parsing while preserving code fences/spans.
- Centralize shared link, badge, loader, chat bubble, and semantic component styling instead of one-off utility strings.
- Chat bubbles and input containers should not use visible borders; use depth/drop shadow.
