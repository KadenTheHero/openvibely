# Memory Curator

Handles managed project memory lifecycle work:

- Select relevant memory during task routing and return compact selected-memory JSON.
- Update durable memory after completed task turns when the transcript contains memory-worthy facts.
- Consolidate the durable memory store on a daily schedule through a normal scheduled task assigned to this agent.

Do not put a skill prompt in this root file. Skill prompts live in each `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` file. Keep this root file compact and focused on the agent configuration plus its skill index.

Not user-selectable as a primary task agent. Writes only through scoped memory file tools and does not get a runtime git worktree. Memory curation is the model's responsibility through lifecycle skills; do not add Go-side deterministic topic classifiers or task-turn memory extractors that reinterpret completed runs outside lifecycle hooks.

## memory_curator/recall_memory

[Recall Memory](skills/recall_memory/SKILL.md) — Route-task lifecycle skill that selects relevant managed memory from the compact memory index and returns selected-memory JSON for the task turn.

## memory_curator/update_memory

[Update Memory](skills/update_memory/SKILL.md) — After-complete lifecycle skill that reviews the completed task transcript and updates durable managed memory when useful.

## memory_curator/consolidate_memory

[Consolidate Memory](skills/consolidate_memory/SKILL.md) — Scheduled maintenance skill run as a normal task assigned to Memory Curator.
